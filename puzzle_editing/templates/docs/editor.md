The main thing editors can do that normal users can't is assign answers to puzzles.

To become an **ðŸ‘’ editor**, ask a **ðŸŽ© superuser** to set you up.

## Rounds and Answers

As an editor, you can create and edit rounds and answers from the "Rounds/Answers" page, linked from the top bar.

PuzzUp also tracks who is spoiled on each round. On the Rounds/Answers page, you only see answers from rounds you're spoiled on.

If a puzzle has an answer assigned, anybody spoiled on the puzzle can see that answer â€” and the round it's assigned to â€” on that puzzle's page.

Each round can have a description and each answer can have notes, both of which are only visible to editors spoiled on the round.

## Assigning Answers

To assign an answer to a puzzle, go to the puzzle and click "edit" in to "**Answers:**" section. You'll be brought to a page with all answers you're spoiled on and can select which answer or answers you want to assign to (or unassign from) the puzzle.

By default, only answers that have not been assigned to other puzzles will be visible; uncheck the "Hide answers assigned to other puzzles" checkbox at the top to show all answers. PuzzUp will also warn you if you try to assign multiple answers to one puzzle. However, it absolutely allows you to have unusual many-to-many relationships between puzzles and answers if you really want to.

There is no way to assign an answer that's not part of a round, but you should feel free to create a "Dummy round", put answers in it, and assign those answers to puzzles in case you ever need the testsolving answer checker to accept partial/intermediate answers or instructions.

## Tags

The list of tags are only visible to editors. You can assign tags to puzzles and then view a list of all puzzles with a particular tag. Authors can also assign tags to their own puzzles.

Some ways tags can be useful:

- Tag puzzles in unusual rounds or with unusual gimmicks.
- Tag puzzles in a particular genre (e.g. cryptic crosswords, logic puzzles) or about a subject (e.g. math, video games), to ensure you don't have too few or too many of them and try to spread them out among rounds.
- Tag puzzles that need or are looking for authors or editors with particular skill sets (e.g. audio/video editing, foreign language fluency).
- Tag puzzles that need special attention later (e.g. they depend on current events and need to be re-factchecked, or they rely on external resources that need to be rehosted).
- Tag backup puzzles or puzzles that can take any answer.

A tag can be "important", which means that the tag will be visible next to the puzzle title in most places.
